# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to this repo! This is a short guide to set you up for running Ballsdex in
a development environment, with some tips on the code structure.

## Setting up the environment

### PostgreSQL and Redis

Using Docker:

1. Install Docker.
2. Run `docker compose build` at the root of this repository.
3. Run `docker compose up -d postgres-db`. This will not start the bot, only the
   database and redis server.

----

Without docker, check how to install and setup PostgreSQL on your OS.
Export the appropriate environment variables as described in the
[README](README.md#without-docker).

### Installing the dependencies

1. Get Python 3.13 and pip.
2. Install poetry with `pip install poetry`.
3. Run `poetry install`.
4. You may run commands inside the virtualenv with `poetry run ...`, or use `poetry shell`.

## Running the code

Before running any command, you must be in the poetry virtualenv, with the following
environment variables exported:

```bash
poetry shell
export BALLSDEXBOT_DB_URL="postgres://ballsdex:defaultballsdexpassword@localhost:5432/ballsdex"
```

If needed, feel free to change the host, port, user or password of the database or redis server.

### Starting the bot

```bash
python3 -m ballsdex --dev --debug
```

You can do `python3 -m ballsdex -h` to see the available options.

### Starting the admin panel

```bash
cd admin_panel
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=admin_panel.settings.dev
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py collectstatic --no-input
uvicorn --reload --reload-include "*.html" admin_panel.asgi:application
```

You will be running the admin panel with additional debug tools. There is the django debug
toolbar to inspect SQL queries, loading times, template loading and other tools. You also get
pyinstrument, allowing you to profile a page by appending `?profile` at the end.

> [!TIP]
> `python3 manage.py` contains a lot of commands, feel free to explore them! To name a few:
>
> - `shell` launches a Python REPL ready to interact with models and database
> - `dbshell` will launch `psql` with the right settings for the database
> - `check` performs general system checks to ensure everything works
> - `createsuperuser` creates a superuser account
> - `showmigrations` shows the applied/missing migrations

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `python3 manage.py runserver` to run the server, since the bot relies on async code.
> Django must be started with an ASGI server, not the default WSGI.

## Integrating your IDE

To have proper autocompletion and type checking, your IDE must be aware of your poetry virtualenv.

The path to Python can be obtained with `poetry env info -p`, copy that and configure your editor
to use it. Some editors like VS code may detect your poetry env automatically when picking
versions.

You can also install extensions to work with black, flake8 and pyright (Pylance for VS code).
Their configurations are already written in `pyproject.toml`, so it should work as-is.

## Migrations

> [!CAUTION]
> The migration engine we've been using in the past is severely broken, and will be removed soon
> in favor of Django's migration engine. In the meantime, all PRs that require database migrations
> are put on hold.

## Coding style

The code is formatted by `black`, style verified by `flake8`, and static checked by `pyright`.
They can be setup as a pre-commit hook to make them run before committing files:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

You can also run them manually:

```sh
pre-commit run -a
```

All rules are defined in `pyproject.toml`, meaning your editor will pick them up if you install
the right tools.
