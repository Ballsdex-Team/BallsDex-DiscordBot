PeriodicDex is a bot for collecting substances on Discord and exchange them with your friends! It is forked from Ballsdex.

You can invite the official bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=999736048596816014&permissions=537193536&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Discord server

For help installing the bot, questions, suggestions to improve or contributions, feel free to join the official community of developers and self-hosters! However, I would recommend installing from the official Ballsdex repository.
